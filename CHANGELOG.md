# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Review interface

- A canvas stays current when the pull request head only merged the base branch in, each merge
  as git would have made it (needs git 2.38 or newer). The page shows the head's
  diffs under a **Canvas still applies** note, review progress carries over, and sign-off keeps
  working. The new `canvas.ignoreMergeCommits` project setting (default `true`) turns this off.
- `pr-review publish` accepts a head that only merged other branches onto the prepared commit
  under the same rule, instead of failing with `CANVAS_STALE`.

### AI chat

- The chat works on an outdated canvas again: it answers about the canvas on screen, with the
  diff of that canvas's commit, instead of refusing with `CANVAS_NOT_FOUND` after every new commit.

### Hosts

- GitLab merge requests work through the [GitLab CLI (`glab`)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli),
  alongside GitHub pull requests through `gh`. Origin detection covers gitlab.com, hostnames that
  contain `gitlab`, and self-hosted GitLab via `PR_REVIEW_HOST=gitlab`.
- Nested GitLab groups (`group/subgroup/project`) are stored as the repository owner.
- Comments, inline discussions, approvals, and canvas-zip discovery use GitLab's REST API.
  Request-changes posts the review body as a merge request note.
- New error codes: `GLAB_MISSING`, `GLAB_UNAUTHENTICATED`, `GITLAB_API_ERROR`. Exit code `4` covers
  both CLIs.

## 0.3.0

Changes since 0.2.0.

### Review interface

- Review history groups submitted reviews and omits empty comment-only events while retaining
  written reviews and approval, change-request, and dismissal decisions.
- Outdated comments appear below review history with replies, original locations, and GitHub
  links. Current comments remain in the diff without a duplicate overview section.
- Clicking directly on a section chevron now expands or collapses it. Keyboard toggling continues
  to work.
- Improved review and tool-call spacing, removed the empty gutter beside inline comments and
  annotations, and added SVG branding.

### AI chat

- Chat floats on smaller screens and becomes a minimizable modal on mobile, with keyboard focus
  containment and Escape to minimize. Drafts survive minimizing and resizing.
- Quick questions now lead with "Suggestion to solve this?" and include five suggested prompts.

### Diagnostics and development

- `serve` logs internal HTTP and chat-stream failures with the request method, path, status,
  error code, and original error details. Expected client errors stay quiet.
- Added Oxlint, Oxfmt, and a pre-commit hook for lint, formatting, strict type checks, and tests.
  CI runs the same checks, executing unit tests once through coverage per Node.js version.

### Upgrade from 0.2.0

1. Run `npm install -g @vintasoftware/pr-review-canvas@0.3.0` and restart `pr-review serve`.
2. Run `pr-review install-skill` in each project to refresh the bundled skill copy. Preserve any
   customizations first, and repeat custom directory flags if used.
3. Existing configuration and saved canvases remain compatible; no migration is required.
4. Contributors should run `corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and `corepack pnpm hooks:install`
   in their clone. Use `pnpm lint:fix` and `pnpm format` to apply automatic fixes.

## 0.2.0

Changes since 0.1.0.

### Review layers

- Generation groups related behavior and decisions into semantic layers. Projects without
  configured layers no longer use a fixed set of eight architecture groups.
- Configured layers provide optional descriptions, path hints, and reading order. The generator
  can combine, split, or reorder them to fit the change. Tests stay with the code they cover.
- Prompt customization instructions are shorter, with detailed rules in `docs/reference.md`.

### Skill installation

- `install-skill` creates portable copies for Claude Code and Codex on every platform.
  Re-running it refreshes managed copies and replaces legacy symlinks.
- Installed skills include a content hash. `doctor` reports outdated or modified copies;
  `serve` warns with a repair command while continuing to start.
- Installation prevents overwriting the bundled skill's source directory.

### Canvas exports

- ZIP filenames include the PR number, UTC generation time, eight-character commit prefix,
  and repository: `pr-42-20260910T110000Z-aaaaaaaa-acme-widgets-canvas.zip`.
- Comparisons before a PR exists use `ref-` instead of `pr-<number>-`. Re-exporting a canvas
  keeps its filename. Attachment discovery recognizes the new names.

### Validation

- Expanded unit coverage for review validation, GitHub attachments, server routes, and UI behavior.
- CI retains coverage reports for seven days for both Node.js versions.

### Upgrade from 0.1.0

1. Run `pr-review install-skill` in each project after upgrading. Repeat custom directory flags
   if used. Preserve customized skills before refreshing managed copies, and commit updated copies.
2. Rename the `prompts` config key `layers-default.md` to `layering-guidance.md`. Update any
   custom generation templates from `{{DEFAULT_LAYERS}}` to `{{CONFIGURED_LAYERS}}` and from
   `{{LAYERS_DEFAULT}}` to `{{LAYERING_GUIDANCE}}`. The old config key is rejected and causes
   configuration to fall back to defaults; old generation tokens fail rendering.
3. Re-export shared canvases and replace their attachments to use automatic discovery in 0.2.0.
   Old ZIP filenames are no longer recognized by discovery; existing archives can still be
   imported manually.
4. Run `prepare` again for updated generation prompts, using `--force` for an existing canvas.
   Restart the server after configuration changes.
